Dear diary, I have so much to tell you. So much has happened since the last time I just sat down and started writing down what I feel. There are so many stories I haven't really shared with you. But why? Why haven't I written anything personal this year on my blog? I don't really have one straight up answer to that question. Only somewhere along the way, I started noticing how much I had distanced myself from my blog. However, there is one biggest factor that played a big part. And that's this: My life felt like a mess. And in that mess, I lost myself.
